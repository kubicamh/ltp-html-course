HTML5 Specialist Designation Program
Lab Exercise #6

We’ll be practicing creating hyperlinks in this lab exercise.

Lab Instructions

1) Run your Brackets development environment.

2) With Brackets running, choose File  New to open a new document. You should see the cursor
flashing on the first line.

3) Immediately save your document using File  Save from the drop-down menus. Navigate to a
folder where you’d like to save your lab exercise. Save your lab under the file name lab_6.html.

Saving your lab at this point will allow you to take advantage of the syntax highlighting features
available in brackets.

4) First you will need to key in the basic document structure. Be careful to key in the HTML5 code
below exactly as it appears.
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
     <head>
         <title>Lab #5</title>
     </head>
     <body>

     </body>
 </html>
We’re using Lab #6 as the content for the title tag in this case.
5) Using what you’ve learned about forms, you’re going to recreate the form following this step. Choose the best
possible form control for each individual data point. Insure that form element limits the range of input to the
degree possible to limit the amount of errant data entered. Make the form as usable and as easy to fill out as
possible. Note: You don’t need to emulate the layout of the sample form—Just obtain the same data from the
user.
6) Once you’ve completed the form test it                Click the Download link towards the top of the
thoroughly in your web browser. Make sure that           page.
each radio button works independently.

7) Visit the web site www.jquerymobile.com. We’re
going to install the jQuery Mobile library to optimize
the display of this document for mobile devices.
8) Locate the copy and paste snippet and past the
following lines in to the head section of your
HTML5:

 <link rel="stylesheet"
 href="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.5/
 jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.css" />
 <script
 src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-
 1.11.1.min.js"></script>
 <script
 src="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.5/j
 query.mobile-1.4.5.min.js"></script>


9) Save your document and test in your browser
again. If using Chrome put your browser in mobile
emulation mode by clicking More Tools 
Developer Tools from the menu button on the right
side of the browser. Once the developer tools are
open, click on the toggle to turn on device mode.
Examine how your form looks in a mobile device
with the jQuery Mobile styling your elements.
